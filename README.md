## Dev tools for silverstripe-graphql
 
 This module adds an implementation of [graphiql](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql), an in-browser IDE for GraphQL servers. It provides browseable documentation of your schema, as well as autocomplete and syntax-checking of your queries.
 
 This tool is available in **dev mode only**. It can be accessed at `/dev/graphiql/`.
